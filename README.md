# CollegeTimeTable
It is a small portable and powerful utility to generate, school and college time table.

Most of of the time table softwares use complex design and parameters to generate time table but as a result often lose simplicity. This software works on the most basic design which can really simplify hundreds of hours of work for teachers of small school/college or education institute. This software uses Spreadsheet design which is easy to understand for novice computer user. 
Another special thing about this utility is that it does not ask to fill up information required but on the contrary it collects the information on the fly
You can start creating time table without entering number of teachers, their names,subjects etc.

No provision for room numbers at present. But can be added in future.
